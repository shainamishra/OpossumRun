# OpossumRun

Assignment

Implement modifications to the Rocket Patrol tutorial game created in class. You construct your grade by selecting from the possibilities below and summing their respective point values (max: 100). Modifications are grouped by relative difficulty. If a higher-tier modification includes one of the lower-tier modifications, you will only receive the points for the higher tier (i.e., no double dipping ðŸ¥¨). Note that some of the more difficult modifications might require you to do some research on Phaser features that we haven't yet covered.

Modifications

Created breathing animations using Tween
  - Not sure if this would count for points but the Opossum and the Fish wiggle.
  - I recieved help from Adam Smith.
  
Add your own (copyright-free) background music to the Play scene (5)
  - Funky royalty-free tunes.
  
Create a new scrolling tile sprite for the background (5)
  - The header flames which I drew.
  
Create a new title screen (e.g., new artwork, typography, layout) (10)
  - I created the title screen from scratch (my first attempt at pixel art!).
  
Create a new spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (20)
  - The fish which is smaller, moves faster, is worth 60 points, and was drawn by me.
  
Create new artwork for all of the in-game assets (rocket, spaceships, explosion) (20) 
  - If the 60 point one is inapplicable for whatever reason.
  
Create and implement a new weapon (w/ new behavior and graphics) (20)
   - The car is worth -10 points.
 
Redesign the game's artwork, UI, and sound to change its theme/aesthetic (to something other than sci-fi) (60)
  - I created an entirely new title screen, a new starfield, a new explosion animation, all new sprites (car, trash, fish, watermelon, opossum, and fire), the fish and the car have different mechanics from the oringal spaceships, I found or made all of my own sounds, and I created a Hell-scape with an Opossum Overlord which is quite different from sci-fi.
